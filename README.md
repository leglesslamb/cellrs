`cellrs` (pronounced "cellars") is a terminal-based battery indicator written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Overview

- `cellrs` displays a battery which resizes with the size of the terminal.
- The battery contains "cells" that scale to the current battery level. These cells are colour-coded based on the percentage of the battery.
- A status line is displayed below the battery showing numerical percentage and charging status.
- Optionally, some cells will blink when the battery is charging.

### Platforms

Supported platforms/versions are generally based on [battery](https://crates.io/crates/battery).

- Linux 2.6.39+
- MacOS 10.10+
- Windows 7+
- FreeBSD
- DragonFlyBSD

### Prerequisites

- There are no specific prerequisites for using `cellrs`.
- For developers, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), including [`cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/).

### Dependencies

- [battery](https://crates.io/crates/battery)
- [chrono](https://crates.io/crates/chrono)
- [termion](https://crates.io/crates/termion)

## Install/Build

There are a few ways you can get and use `cellrs`.

- Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

  ```sh
  cargo install cellrs
  ```

- Download a release binary from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/leglesslamb/cellrs/-/releases) and put it somewhere in your `$PATH`.
- Build from [source](https://gitlab.com/leglesslamb/cellrs).

  ```sh
  git clone https://gitlab.com/leglesslamb/cellrs.git
  cd cellrs
  make install
  ```

### Usage

```help
usage : ./cellrs
        -b [blink-width]  Set custom blink-width [16-bit unsigned] (defaults to 1).
        -h                Display this help message.
```

#### Keyboard Controls

- `b` cycles through the blink-width value.
  - If your custom blink-width is `0` or unset, it will cycle through `{0,1,<max-width>,...}`.
  - If your custom blink-width is `1`, it will cycle through `{1,<max-width>,0,...}`.
  - Otherwise, it will cycle through `{<custom-width>,<max-width>,0,1,...}`.
- `q` quits `cellrs`.
